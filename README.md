# @voxeline/physics

**Status: Unstable**

**You may want to use the [original version](https://github.com/andyhall/voxel-physics-engine) of this module**

An abstracted physics engine for voxel game engines.

This implements reasonably realistic physics for voxel games.
It was made to work with voxel.js, but it only takes references to
an abstracted `getBlock(x,y,z)` function and plain vectors,
so it can be used with other engines.

This replaces, and is modeled very loosely on,
[voxel-physical](https://github.com/chrisdickinson/voxel-physical),
though it works quite differently and behaves more physically.

The engine can be seen in action in [noa-hello-world](https://github.com/andyhall/noa-hello-world).

## Usage:
 1. Create engine and supply a `getBlock(x,y,z)`-like function (which should return true when block xyz is solid)
 1. Register rigid bodies with `var body = addBody(..)`
 1. Control them with `body.addImpulse[0,1,0]` and so on
 1. Call `tick(dt)`

and the engine will manage all the physics and collisions.

## Example

``` javascript
var makePhysics = require('voxel-physics-engine')
var opts = { gravity: [0,-10,0] }
var getter = queryBlock // function(x,y,z)
var phys = makePhysics( opts, getter )
var body = phys.addBody( aabb, mass, friction, restitution, gravityMult, onCollide, autoStep )
phys.tick( dt_in_miliseconds )
phys.removeBody( body )
```

## Features

 * Reasonably physical, supports standard properties (friction, restitution, etc.)
 * Query the body's `resting[axis]` property (-1,0,1 on each axis) to tell if it's currently resting against an obstacle.
   E.g. `body.resting[1]` is `1` when the body is colliding with the ceiling.
 * Collisions with terrain trigger each body's `onCollide(impacts)` callback.
   The argument is a `vec3` of the change in velocity on each axis, so multiply by mass if you want the impulse.
   (A body resting on the ground will produce a small impact each tick due to gravity.)
 * If you set a body's `autoStep` property, the engine will cause it to
   automatically "step" up hills (i.e. 1-block obstructions).
